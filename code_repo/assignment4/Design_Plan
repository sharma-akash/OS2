Design Plan:

For these algorithms, both the efficiency computation and the best-fit allocation, the design plan is as follows. 
It will be necessary to first investigate the first-fit algorithm in the slob.c file and use that as a base template 
to develop our best-fit algorithm. The first-fit algorithm simply scans memory and the first free part it finds that 
can fit the given data, it will allocate to. The best-fit seeks further and tries to find the closest match, so the 
implementation will need editing in this regard. The changes made will be easily recorded within a patch file and 
we will be able to consider how the two differ. Further, we will utilize the syscall() function to test our program 
and contrast the free and used space in memory.
